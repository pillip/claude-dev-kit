"""ISSUE-103 — the implement/red checkpoint must be scoped to the branch's own tests.

`verify_implement_red` has deliberately inverted logic: a non-zero test-run exit
is the expected ("RED") outcome. Before this contract it ran the WHOLE worktree
suite, so **any** pre-existing unrelated failure certified the TDD RED phase even
when the branch's new tests passed — a control whose defeated output was
byte-identical to its healthy output.

**Unit of attribution: the changed test FILE.** The scoping input is the one the
verifier already computes for its file-existence and hollow-assertion checks
(`_existing(wt_path, _changed_files_vs_base(wt_path, base))`) — no second oracle
is derived here. The failure modes this unit accepts are listed in
`verify_checkpoint._failed_test_files`' docstring and in the PR body.

Coverage layers:

* ``TestRedScopeRealConsumer`` — drives the REAL consumer
  (``bash scripts/checkpoint.sh --skill implement --phase red``) as a subprocess
  against a throwaway git repo with three registered worktrees and REAL pytest
  children, in both the arm and the disarm direction (review lesson 16).
  These are bounded: each child run collects a single two-line test file, so
  this is **not** the recursive full-suite spawn TC-047g removed.
* ``TestRedScopeArgv`` / ``TestRedScopeLegacyRoutes`` / ``TestFailedTestFiles``
  — unit pins with ``vc._run`` mocked at the subprocess seam.
