# Issues

> SSOT: Progress and completion are tracked by the Status field in this document (not inferred from code analysis)
> Rule: **1 Issue = 1 PR** (GitHub-first)

## Conventions
- Track: `product` | `platform`
- Status: `backlog` | `doing` | `waiting` | `done` | `drop`
- Priority: `P0` (blocks everything) | `P1` (core) | `P2` (nice-to-have)
- Estimate: `0.5d` | `1d` | `1.5d` (> 1.5d must be split)
- Branch: `issue/ISSUE-<NNN>-<slug>`
- GitHub: **/implement creates a GH Issue (if missing) + PR and links them (Closes #N)**
